<!--
1. React Core Concepts

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its core concepts revolve around components, which are reusable building blocks of a UI.
React applications are made of multiple components, which manage their state and render UIs based on that state.


2. Components

Components are independent, reusable pieces of UI that can be written as either functions or classes in React.
Each component returns a portion of the UI that React can render.

Example: -->



function Welcome() {
  return <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;
}

<!--
This simple functional component returns an h1 element that displays "Welcome to React!"


3. Creating Components

In React, you can create a component by defining a function or class that returns a React element.

Example: -->



function Header() {
  return <header>This is the header</header>;
}

<!--
This Header component can be reused across different parts of the app.


4. Nesting Components

Components can be nested inside each other. This allows you to create complex UIs by combining smaller, simpler components.

Example: -->


function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}

function MainContent() {
  return <p>This is the main content.</p>;
}

function Footer() {
  return <footer>This is the footer.</footer>;
}

<!--
Here, the App component nests Header, MainContent, and Footer components, showing how components work together.


5. Component Trees

The UI of a React application is structured as a component tree. The top-most component is often referred to as the "root" component,
and it branches out into smaller nested components.

Example: In the example, App is the root of the tree, and it branches into three child components: Header, MainContent, and Footer. -->


App
 ├─ Header
 ├─ MainContent
 └─ Footer

<!-- This tree structure allows for easy management of complex UIs by breaking them into manageable pieces. -->

<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<!--
1. Displaying Data with Props
Props (short for "properties") are used to pass data from a parent component to a child component in React.
This allows components to be more reusable and dynamic by accepting different values.

Example: -->

function Greeting(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Greeting name="Putin" />;
}

<!-- In this example, the Greeting component takes props.name as an input and displays a personalized greeting.
The App component passes the name "Syed" to the Greeting component via props.

2. Using Props
You can pass any type of data through props, including strings, numbers, arrays, and objects. The child component accesses these props using props.propName.

Example: -->

function UserProfile(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{props.user.name}</h2>
      <p>Age: {props.user.age}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

function App() {
  const user = { name: "Putin", age: 25 };
  return <UserProfile user={user} />;
}

<!--Here, the UserProfile component receives an object user as a prop and displays the name and age of the user.

3. Using Variables in JSX
In JSX, you can embed JavaScript expressions by wrapping them in curly braces {}. This allows you to display dynamic values or execute simple expressions inside JSX.

Example: -->

function App() {
  const name = "Putin";
  const isLoggedIn = true;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      {isLoggedIn ? <p>Welcome back!</p> : <p>Please sign in.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

<!-- In this example, the name variable and the isLoggedIn boolean are used inside JSX to display dynamic content.

4. Iterating Through Lists
You can display lists of data by using the map() function in JSX to iterate through arrays.
Each item in the array should be rendered inside a component, and each element needs a unique key to help React optimize the rendering.

Example: -->

function TodoList(props) {
  return (
    <ul>
      {props.todos.map((todo, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{todo}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

function App() {
  const todos = ["Learn React", "Build Projects", "Practice Coding"];
  return <TodoList todos={todos} />;
}

<!--In this example, the TodoList component receives an array of tasks as props and iterates over the list to display each item in an unordered list. -->
